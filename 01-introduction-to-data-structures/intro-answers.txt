How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

  In the line.rb, screen.rb, and pixel.rb files, the following classes contain accessors.
    These accessors via the command 'attr_accessor' allow the properties of the object
    to be read and put out of class. While data structures created with these classes
    can be viewed and manipulated from outside the class.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

  The data structure is based on arrays, searching for an element is based on regular array functions.
  exp: array.include?

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

  In the line example, an inventory control system would be a good example of this
  algorithm. A new product comes in, it goes to the back then the stock person
  can take any which one from stock.
